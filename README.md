**READMEs for these projects are currently in progress.**

As of now, the best project description in the repository is the "Statistical Criteria for Open Text" project, where I implemented all existing lossless compression algorithms from scratch, built statistical criteria based on them, and found inaccuracies in the .NET documentation.

If you run parts of the .NET code on a non-Windows system, you are likely to encounter problems. Therefore, for cross-platform compatibility and practice, it would be interesting to package everything into a Docker container. At the moment I leave the debugging questions to the reader.
