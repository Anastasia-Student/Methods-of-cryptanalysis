**READMEs for these projects are currently in progress.**

As of now, the best project description in the repository is the !["Statistical Criteria for Open Text"](https://github.com/Anastasia-Student/Methods-of-cryptanalysis/tree/main/Lab2%20(Statistical%20Criteria%20for%20Open%20Text)) project, where I have implemented all existing lossless compression algorithms from scratch, built statistical criteria based on them, and found inaccuracies in the .NET documentation.

If you run parts of the .NET code on a non-Windows system, you are likely to encounter problems. Therefore, for cross-platform compatibility and practice, it would be interesting to package everything into a Docker container. At the moment, I leave the debugging questions to the reader.
